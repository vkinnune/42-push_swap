# 42-push_swap
The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions and the stacks are first in, first out.

In Push_swap, we couldn't just copy and paste an already made sorting algorithm from the internet because of the restrictions and rules we were given. We had to think from scratch, make a custom solution, and understand the problem.

We learned the concept or the stack that comes in handy in breadth-first search algorithms in the next project called Lem_in.
